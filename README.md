# Notes:

## Setup
I used a boilerplate I had previously created with an attached MaterialsUI template as a starting point. It doesn't always make sense to build something completely from scratch if there are templates or boilplates that can help get you started and work more effectively towards a clients needs. Granted this would be situation dependant on if it makes sense and the stakeholder's desires/situation. In this case, to make use of the limit time the templates offered an effective way to jumpstart on styling and some basic components that I could then move on from and develop what I needed to from there. 

## Things Not including
- oauth, login/out functionality
- different role designations: admin, etc
- separate views of active vs inactive recruits
- specific sections for notes on each interview phase and who the recruiter was in that phase
- notes on if the candidates needs to relocate
- start dates
- maybe graphs of number of candidates in each phase
- lots of things can be added but for time constrainst will keep to test requirements

## Things Including
- dashboard list of active recruitees
- search on dashboard
- candidate details
- delete candidate
- add candidate
